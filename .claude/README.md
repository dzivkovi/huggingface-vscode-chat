- `/explore` - Chat about possible approaches
- `/issue` - Create GitHub issues (my take on [Compound Engineering](https://every.to/c/compounding-engineering))
- `/work` - Implement GitHub issue using TDD
- `/resume` - Continue interrupted work
- `/kanban` - Retroactive documentation for completed work
- `/note` - Persist learnings from current session
- `/reflection` - Improvement analysis (inspired by [https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1laby6h/](https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1laby6h/))
