# TGI Successful Setup Summary

Date: 2025-09-15 at 21:11:23 PST

## Context
User asked to investigate TGI errors and experiment while they went for a walk. Successfully diagnosed and fixed the TGI setup issue, got StarCoder2-3B running, and documented findings for tomorrow's decision between TGI and Ollama.

## User Query
"please read full /tmp/tgi.log file as i have error even wit this small model. Figure out what happened, ultrathink to see if this is repearable and then choose if we need to update analysis/2025-09-15/15-tgi-model-attempts-summary.md file"

## Analysis and Findings

### Problem Identified
The initial TGI failure with StarCoder2-3B was caused by:
- **Error**: `AssertionError` at line 133 - `assert max_input_tokens is not None`
- **Root cause**: Missing `--max-input-tokens` parameter in the Docker command
- **Solution**: Added `--max-input-tokens 4096` to the launch parameters

### Successful Configuration
```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -p 8080:80 \
  -v /home/daniel/work/huggingface-vscode-chat/data:/data \
  ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:2.4.1 \
  --model-id bigcode/starcoder2-3b \
  --quantize bitsandbytes-nf4 \
  --max-total-tokens 8192 \
  --max-input-tokens 4096  # This parameter was missing and critical
```

### Performance Metrics Collected

#### Startup Performance
- **Model download**: 16 minutes 26 seconds (cached after first run)
- **Shard initialization**: 97 seconds
- **Total startup time**: ~2 minutes when model is cached

#### Inference Performance
- **Speed**: ~26.7ms per token (37 tokens/second)
- **100 tokens generation**: 2.67 seconds
- **200 tokens generation**: 5.28 seconds
- **Memory usage**: 6.6GB VRAM out of 8GB available
- **GPU utilization**: 19% during idle, higher during inference

#### Test Results
1. **Fibonacci function**: Successfully generated recursive implementation
2. **QuickSort function**: Correctly implemented with pivot logic
3. **Response quality**: Code generation accurate but sometimes repetitive

### Key Discoveries

#### TGI Limitations
1. **No CPU support**: Confirmed TGI requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA
2. **Corporate laptop incompatible**: Won't work on non-GPU systems
3. **Memory constraints**: Even 3B model uses 6.6GB VRAM with quantization
4. **Parameter documentation**: Some critical parameters not well documented

#### Success Rate Summary
- **Failed models**: 3 (DeepSeek-Coder, Phi-3.5, CodeGemma)
- **Successful models**: 1 (StarCoder2-3B)
- **Success rate**: 25%

### Recommendations for Tomorrow

#### Primary Recommendation: Use Ollama
- **Rationale**: Works on both CPU and GPU, simpler setup, better memory management
- **Model choice**: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B (Ollama can handle it, TGI cannot on 8GB VRAM)

#### If Continuing with TGI
- Only StarCoder2-3B confirmed working
- Too small for serious development work
- No path forward for corporate laptop without GPU

### Files Updated
1. **15-tgi-model-attempts-summary.md**: Updated with successful StarCoder2-3B configuration
2. **16-tgi-vs-ollama-final-comparison.md**: Created comprehensive comparison document

### Next Steps
The TGI server with StarCoder2-3B is currently running successfully on port 8080 for further testing if needed. Tomorrow's decision point: implement Ollama integration for broader hardware compatibility or continue troubleshooting TGI's limitations.
