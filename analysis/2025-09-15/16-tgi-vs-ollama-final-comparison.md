# TGI vs Ollama: Final Comparison for Tomorrow's Decision

Date: 2025-09-15 at 21:05:00 PST

## Context
After extensive testing with TGI and initial setup with Ollama, documenting findings to help decide between the two inference solutions for the VS Code Hugging Face extension.

## TGI Testing Summary

### Successful Model
**StarCoder2-3B** - The only model that worked successfully with TGI

#### Working Configuration
```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -p 8080:80 \
  -v /home/daniel/work/huggingface-vscode-chat/data:/data \
  ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:2.4.1 \
  --model-id bigcode/starcoder2-3b \
  --quantize bitsandbytes-nf4 \
  --max-total-tokens 8192 \
  --max-input-tokens 4096  # Critical parameter - must be specified
```

#### Performance Metrics
- **Download time**: 16 minutes 26 seconds (first time only)
- **Startup time**: 97 seconds for shard initialization
- **Memory usage**: 6.6GB VRAM out of 8GB available
- **Inference speed**: ~26.7ms per token (37 tokens/second)
- **100 tokens generation**: 2.67 seconds
- **200 tokens generation**: 5.28 seconds

### Failed Models
1. **DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B**: Out of memory (needs 13.4GB VRAM)
2. **Phi-3.5-mini-instruct**: Out of memory during KV cache allocation
3. **CodeGemma-2B**: Gated model requiring authentication
4. **Qwen2.5-Coder-7B**: Not attempted (would likely OOM)

### Key TGI Limitations Discovered
1. **No CPU support**: TGI requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA
2. **Memory constraints**: Even with quantization, larger models fail on 8GB VRAM
3. **Parameter requirements**: Some parameters like `--max-input-tokens` are mandatory but not documented
4. **Complex debugging**: Errors often cryptic (e.g., `AssertionError` without context)
5. **Long initialization**: ~90+ seconds startup time even for small models

## Ollama Alternative

### Advantages
1. **CPU + GPU support**: Works on both, automatically uses GPU when available
2. **Automatic quantization**: Handles memory management transparently
3. **Simple setup**: 10-minute installation vs hours of TGI debugging
4. **Better Windows support**: Native Windows binaries available
5. **Consistent model naming**: Same models work across all hardware
6. **5-10x GPU speedup**: Automatically accelerates when GPU detected

### Recommended Models for Ollama
```bash
# Top choice for RTX 4060
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

# Alternatives
ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b
ollama pull codellama:7b
```

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | TGI (StarCoder2-3B) | Ollama (Expected) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Setup Time | 2-4 hours debugging | 10 minutes |
| CPU Support | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| GPU Support | ✅ NVIDIA only | ✅ NVIDIA/AMD/Metal |
| Memory Management | Manual, often fails | Automatic |
| Model Size Limit (8GB) | ~3B parameters | ~7B with quantization |
| Startup Time | 90+ seconds | 5-10 seconds |
| Token Speed (GPU) | 37 tokens/sec | 30-50 tokens/sec |
| Token Speed (CPU) | N/A | 2-12 tokens/sec |

## Architecture Decision Matrix

### Option 1: Pure Ollama
**Pros:**
- Simple, single codebase
- Works everywhere (CPU/GPU)
- Easy maintenance
- Consistent user experience

**Cons:**
- Not using HF Router infrastructure
- Requires local installation

### Option 2: Dual Mode (TGI + Ollama)
**Pros:**
- Optimal for each environment
- Uses existing HF Router when possible

**Cons:**
- 3x code complexity
- Different models per backend
- Sync issues across devices
- Testing burden

### Option 3: Keep Current (HF Router only)
**Pros:**
- No local setup required
- Managed infrastructure

**Cons:**
- Requires internet connection
- API key management
- Usage limits

## Recommendation for Tomorrow

### Primary Recommendation: **Use Ollama**
Given your experience today:
- TGI had 3 failures, 1 success (25% success rate)
- StarCoder2-3B is too small for serious coding tasks
- Your corporate laptop has no GPU (TGI won't work at all)
- Ollama provides better developer experience

### Implementation Approach
1. **Quick Win**: Modify extension to support Ollama endpoint
2. **ENV Variable**: `INFERENCE_BACKEND=ollama` for local, `router` for cloud
3. **Auto-detection**: Check if Ollama is running locally, fallback to HF Router

### Next Steps for Tomorrow Morning
1. Confirm Ollama works with Qwen2.5-Coder-7B
2. Test VS Code extension with Ollama endpoint
3. Decide on architecture (pure Ollama vs dual-mode)
4. Implement chosen solution

## Conclusion

While TGI eventually worked with StarCoder2-3B after significant troubleshooting, the experience highlights its limitations for consumer hardware. Ollama's simplicity, broader hardware support, and automatic memory management make it the pragmatic choice for your use case, especially considering the corporate laptop constraint.

The successful TGI setup with StarCoder2-3B proves the concept works, but the 3B model is too limited for serious development work. Ollama will allow you to run the recommended 7B models (Qwen2.5-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder) that failed in TGI due to memory constraints.
