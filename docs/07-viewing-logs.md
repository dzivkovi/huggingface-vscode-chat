## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Response from TGI
Look for:
- `Processing TGI request to...` - Confirms request is being sent
- `Request sent to...` - Shows the exact endpoint
- `Stream started` - Indicates server is responding
- Any ERROR entries about timeouts or connection issues

### Parse Errors
Look for:
- `Failed to parse SSE line` - Shows malformed data from server
- The logged data fragment helps identify format issues

### Connection Drops
Look for:
- `Stream read error - connection may have dropped`
- `Stream timeout - no data received for 60 seconds`
- Stack traces in ERROR logs

## Reload After Configuration Changes

When you change the TGI endpoint in settings, the extension will prompt you to reload. Check the logs after reload to confirm the new endpoint is configured correctly.
